# ChilledBot

 A simple, and chill Discord bot.

## Requirements

- [Python 3.8 and up](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/download/)

## Self-Hosting

I do not really support self-hosting the bot. This code is meant for educational purposes.
You can always invite the bot using the [invite link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=694492456951218267&scope=bot).
