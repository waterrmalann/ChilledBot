## Self-Hosting

I do not really support hosting an instance of the bot. This code is meant for educational purposes.
If you really do want to host a version of the bot yourself, please contact me on Discord at AlanTheKiwi#1700 first.
I'd really appreciate it and would be happy to support if you do that.
You can always invite the bot using the [invite link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=694492456951218267&scope=bot).
